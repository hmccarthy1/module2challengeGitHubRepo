    <h2>Hi, I'm Hunter McCarthy</h2>

    <h3>I'm a web developer</h3>

    <h4>
        I'm Currently in coding boot camp at UCF. It's a high velocity, high intensity course that teaches you how 
        to build web applications, starting from scratch. I'm learning HTML, CSS, & JS at the moment. I particularly enjoy
        working on back-end projects that require analytical thinking.

                Excel vba
            </h3>
            <h4>
                Excel VBA is a tool to quickly manipulate data in excel in an automated fashion that would be tedious to do
                manually. I learned this working in Walmart's supply chain in a position that required a lot of data 
                analytics.

                Microsoft Power FX
            </h3>
            <h4>
                Power FX is the language behind Microsoft's Power Platform, which is Microsoft's solution for 
                low-code rapid software development. I self-taught, learning the ins and outs of provisioning data tables,
                managing data relationships, UI/UX, etc.

            </h3>
            <h4>
                I learned these coding languages as part of UCF's coding bootcamp, which is a high-velocity, high-intensity
                coding bootcamp designed to bring participants up to the skill level needed to become a full-stack web 
                developer. I learned all about these languages, the software development lifecycle, and developing software as 
                part of a team.

                Logical Thinking
            </h3>
            <h4>
                I've had many jobs which center around a logical, structured approach to problem-solving. Working in Walmart's
                supply chain, I was responsible within my warehouse for analyzing the item profile for the building, ensuring
                that orderfillers could operate with maximum efficiency for minimum effort. I transitioned to the role of "Process 
                Technician" for a startup company, Boateka, which is a division of Brunswick. I was responsible for analyzing 
                process breakdowns, and ended up utilizing PowerApps to transition the company aware from operating almost entirely
                on paper. The software I developed is of critical importance to the Operations side of Boateka to this day.

                Growth Rate
            </h3>
            <h4>
                I've had lots of experiences where I've had to put myself in a position where I either need or want to develop 
                new skills incredibly quickly. I thrive on challenges and get huge amounts of satisfaction from being able
                to grow my skill set. I'm largely self-taught, and have the necessary mentality to continue to grow.

            <h3>
                Work Ethic
            </h3>
            <h4>
                I hold myself to extremely high standards. I strive to do the right thing in every situation I'm faced with, 
                and I believe in always putting in your best effort. Like anyone else, I have my weak points and gaps, but I'm
                honest with myself about them, acknowledge my own limitations, and I never hesitate to reach out for help when I 
                need it. I'm a team player, always ready to help others, and I'm used to putting in a lot of hours.

            <h3>
               Freediving
            </h3>
            <h4>
                In between work and school, I like to freedive in some of florida's freshwater springs. They offer stunningly
                clear water, new sights and experiences every visit, and a great source of engaging exercise. My most common
                spring to visit is Blue Springs, in Port Orange, FL.

            <h3> 
                Reading
            </h3>
            <h4>
                I love reading, particularly fantasy. My go-to style of book typically involves magic, mystery, and dragons. 
                My favorite book series is the Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini. Other favorites include Patrick Rothfuss's
                Kingerkiller Chronicles, and Pierce Brown's Red Rising series.

                Video games
            </h3>
            <h4>
                I've been a gamer for over a decade, dating all the way back to the PS2. Right now I'm spending a lot of time on 
                Elden Ring, but I also enjoy things like COD Zombies, Skyrim, and Minecraft.

                        I first learned VBA while working in a data analysis type position in Walmart's Supply Chain.
                        Walmart's legacy system, GLS, imports and exports files in CSV format, so performing bulk operations
                        can often require a lot of editing things in excel, which can be tedious to perform without automation. 
                        I used vba to help automate a lot of the manual work I was doing in order to focus more on planning/strategy.

                        I took a position at a startup company, where basically everything was done on paper, by hand. I
                        identified the need for quick development of robust software to enhance existing business processes and 
                        enable the implementation of new ones. I taught myself the PowerPlatform platform, which is Microsoft's
                        low-code developer platform, perfect for creating data tables/relationships quickly, and provides a
                        development suite to create software incredibly quickly. The apps I created are now integral in every
                        aspect of the business.

                    <h4>
                        After my previous experiences left me thirsty for more software development knowledge, I enrolled at UCF's
                        coding boot camp. It's an aggresive, 6 month program that requires a lot of investment and focus. While
                        still working at the startup 40-50 hours a week, I attended classes for another 10 hours a week, and spent
                        another 10-20 hours a week studying. I learned all about HTML, CSS, and JS during this course. I practiced
                        real-world examples, worked closely with a team, and practiced the software development lifecycle endlessly.
                        I gained a robust understanding of the core web languages, how to build software from scratch, and how to 
                        continue growing.
