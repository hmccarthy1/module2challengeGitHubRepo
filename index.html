    <h2>Hi, I'm Hunter McCarthy</h2>

    <h3>I'm a web developer</h3>

    <h4>
        I'm Currently in coding boot camp at UCF. It's a high velocity, high intensity course that teaches you how 
        to build web applications, starting from scratch. I'm learning HTML, CSS, & JS at the moment. I particularly enjoy
        working on back-end projects that require analytical thinking.

                        I first learned VBA while working in a data analysis type position in Walmart's Supply Chain.
                        Walmart's legacy system, GLS, imports and exports files in CSV format, so performing bulk operations
                        can often require a lot of editing things in excel, which can be tedious to perform without automation. 
                        I used vba to help automate a lot of the manual work I was doing in order to focus more on planning/strategy.

                        I took a position at a startup company, where basically everything was done on paper, by hand. I
                        identified the need for quick development of robust software to enhance existing business processes and 
                        enable the implementation of new ones. I taught myself the PowerPlatform platform, which is Microsoft's
                        low-code developer platform, perfect for creating data tables/relationships quickly, and provides a
                        development suite to create software incredibly quickly. The apps I created are now integral in every
                        aspect of the business.

                    <h4>
                        After my previous experiences left me thirsty for more software development knowledge, I enrolled at UCF's
                        coding boot camp. It's an aggresive, 6 month program that requires a lot of investment and focus. While
                        still working at the startup 40-50 hours a week, I attended classes for another 10 hours a week, and spent
                        another 10-20 hours a week studying. I learned all about HTML, CSS, and JS during this course. I practiced
                        real-world examples, worked closely with a team, and practiced the software development lifecycle endlessly.
                        I gained a robust understanding of the core web languages, how to build software from scratch, and how to 
                        continue growing.
