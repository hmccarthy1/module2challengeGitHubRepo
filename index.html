                        I took a position at a startup company, where basically everything was done on paper, by hand. I
                        identified the need for quick development of robust software to enhance existing business processes and 
                        enable the implementation of new ones. I taught myself the PowerPlatform platform, which is Microsoft's
                        low-code developer platform, perfect for creating data tables/relationships quickly, and provides a
                        development suite to create software incredibly quickly. The apps I created are now integral in every
                        aspect of the business.
